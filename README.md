# Image-Retrieval

Make a model for searching for similar images based on a given one, i.e. Image Retrieval. Metadata can also be used to search for similar images.

Flow of the work:
1. The assembled datasetâ€™s metadata is cleaned and preprocessed
2. The images and metadata are translated into image and text embeddings correspondingly
3. Make a model for searching for similar images based on a given image and metadata
4. Validation of the model using Mean Average Precision metric
